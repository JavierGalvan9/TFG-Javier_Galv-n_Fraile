    "In Computational Complexity Theory, a *decision problem* is a problem with a yes or no answer. **NP** is a complexity class that represents the set of decision problems in which it can be checked in a reasonable time whether a solution of the problem is valid or not. However, it requires a *nondeterministic polynomial time* to find a solution to the problem. \n",

    "Finally, a problem H is **NP-hard** when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H; that is, assuming a solution for H takes 1 unit time, we can use H's solution to solve L in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP, which is unlikely as many of them are considered difficult. Note that NP-hard problems do not have to be in NP, and they do not have to be decision problems. [1][2]\n",
