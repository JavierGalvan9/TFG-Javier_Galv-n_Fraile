In the late twentieth century it was discovered that it applied not just to these particles, but to information itself. This led to a revolution in the science and technology of information processing, making possible previously unimagined kinds of computing and communication.*\n",

    "*A row of N coins, each of which might be heads or tails, has  2N possible states, but it actually is in only one of them—we just don’t know which. For this reason, quantum superposition is a more powerful resource than classical probabilism.*\n",

    "*Entanglement is a property of most quantum superpositions and does not occur in classical superpositions. In an entangled state, the whole system is in a definite state, even though the parts are not. Observing one of two entangled particles makes it behave randomly, but tells the observer exactly how the other particle would act if a similar observation were made on it. Because entanglement involves a correlation between individually random behaviors of the two particles, it cannot be used to send a message. Therefore, the term “instantaneous action at a distance,” sometimes used to describe entanglement, is a misnomer. There is no action, only correlation, which, though uncannily perfect, can only be detected afterward when the two observers compare notes. The ability of quantum computers to exist in entangled states is responsible for much of their extra computing power, as well as many other feats of quantum information processing that cannot be performed, or even described, classically.*"

The basic mode employs a textbook implementation, where a series of ccx Toffoli gates are linked together in a V shape to achieve the desired Multiple-Control Toffoli operation. This mode requires  $n-2$  ancillary qubits, where    is the number of controls. For the advanced mode, the cccx and ccccx operations are achieved without needing ancillary qubits. Multiple-Control Toffoli operations for higher number of controls (5 and above) are implemented recursively using these lower-number-of-control cases. For the noancilla mode, no ancillary qubits are needed even for higher number of controls. This uses a technique of spliting multiple-control Toffoli operations, which is efficient up to 8 controls but gets inefficient in the number of required basic gates for values above. This technique relies on mcu1, see mcux for more information.\n",
