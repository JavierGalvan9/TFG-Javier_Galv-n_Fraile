# TFG-Javier_Galvan_Fraile
Jupyter notebooks worked out during my TFG in quantum computation.\\
To make it work you must download Qiskit library from: https://qiskit.org/
Then you must paste the file: javi. ; at the following location: C:\..\Anaconda3\envs\Qiskit\Lib\site-packages\qiskit\aqua\components\optimizers
And thats it!
